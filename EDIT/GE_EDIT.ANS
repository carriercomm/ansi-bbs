  GEdit allows you to enter and reply to messages using a familiar, easy-to-
  use full-screen interface.  GEdit allows the use of the cursor keys, as well
  as several special purpose keys to make message editing easier.

  GEdit includes many of the more common features such as insert mode text
  editing, automatic paragraph reformatting, and automatic word wrap.

  GEdit supports most terminal emulation protocols that are commonly used on
  major BBS packages.  ANSI-BBS, ANSI 3.64, AVATAR/0 and AVATAR/0+ are fully
  supported and the features of each mode are exploited to provide the best
  possible performance.
